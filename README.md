Apparently, these are all the things you need to install to make it work on Fedora :
```
libmpc-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel  libX11-devel  libICE-devel  libSM-devel  libxkbcommon-devel  libXaw-devel  libxcb-devel  libXpm-devel  libXt-devel libudev-devel libxkbfile-devel  libxcb-cursor-devel  libxcb-errors-devel  libxcb-ewmh-devel  libxcb-icccm-devel  libxcb-image-devel  libxcb-keysyms-devel libXrandr-devel libXcursor-devel
```
Some of them doesn't even exist, that's ok
